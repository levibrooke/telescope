# Telescope
A Stock Ticker for the Political Economy.

## Background
In 2018, I worked with [Circa Victor](https://circavictor.com/) to build a web application to demonstrate a data set they collected to show how money moves through our elections. The application is no longer supported by the team, but I received permission to host it using placeholder data.
